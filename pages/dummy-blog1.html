Everyone should be consistent in the effort they put forth in their relationships with their family members, friends, and colleagues. </h3>

  <h2> 1.Develop Consistent Habits</h2> 
  <h3>
If you are looking for a way to be more consistent in your life, the first thing you need to do is develop more consistent habits. The only way you will be more consistent is if you start from the ground up. There are few ways you can do exactly that. These include: 


Be Realistic in Your Goals: You will have a difficult time being consistent if you do not have an idea of what you need to do. Therefore, create easy, simple goals that have objective results that are easy to measure. You could start by defining what consistency means to you. Then, you should come up with smaller steps you have to follow to reach that goal. 
Stick to a Schedule: In order to be consistent, you need to know what you have to do every day. Therefore, you should create a schedule for yourself. Whether this is a planner, a calendar, or a list of reminders on your phone, this will help you stay on track. That way, you will figure out what commitments you do and do not have time for.
Use Reminders: This is a new habit, so you need to remind yourself what you are doing. Try to place reminders on your belongings, around your home, and throughout your workspace or school. It is easy to forget new commitments and calls, especially when you are trying to change your routine. Put messages in visible locations, so you remind yourself throughout the day. 
</h3>

<h2>2. Handling Mistakes in Your Routine</h2>
<h3>
No matter how hard you try to be consistent, you are going to make mistakes from time to time. Therefore, try to keep going even if you make a mistake. Even if you are incredibly organized, you are going to slip up from time to time. Therefore, you should plan from mistakes along the way. If you make a mistake, try not to beat yourself up for it. This is something that happens from time to time.

Even if you break a promise, miss a deadline, or have to cancel on somebody, this doesn't necessarily mean you are ruining your consistency. The reality is that external factors can get in the way. Even though it is important to plan for these external factors and try to prevent them from knocking us off track, it will happen from time to time.


Always figure out what you can do next. That way, you can figure out how to improve. Remember that consistency and perfection are not the same things. Nobody is perfect. Be forgiving of yourself; however, do not make a habit of letting things fall through the cracks.

<h2>3. Increase Your Willpower</h2>
<h3>
You do not expect to step outside your front door and run a marathon if you haven't done any athletic training. It will take some time for you to build your willpower as well. If you become more consistent, you will increase your willpower, allow you to perform well even when you do not feel like it. Of course, the only way you are going to do that is if you practice.

For example, you should avoid temptation when you can. If you want to be more consistent in what you eat, make sure you have healthy options laying around. This will help you build the willpower to avoid eating junk food. 


Furthermore, you should remind yourself of the long-term benefits of being consistent. Whenever you need a source of inspiration, take a look at your list of goals. This could motivate you to complete everything you have to do during the day even when you do not feel like it. These simple steps can go a long way toward helping you increase your willpower.</h3> 

<h2>4. Get Plenty of Sleep</h2>
<h3>
If you want to be more consistent, you must have the energy to do so. That means you have to get plenty of sleep at night. The average adult needs between seven and eight hours of sleep every evening. People who are still in school require even more. A few ways you can get more sleep include:

Try to stay away from screens before bed. The blue light emitted by electronic screens can trigger your brain to keep you awake. 
Go to sleep at the same time every evening. If you train your body to go to bed at the same time, you will fall asleep faster when you get in bed.
Avoid caffeine in the afternoon. Even though you may get tired, try to stay away from coffee, soda, and caffeinated tea. Caffeine can stay in your system for several hours, making it hard for you to go to sleep at night. 

These are a few ways you can get more sleep every evening. If you give your body a chance to recharge, you will have an easier time staying consistent the next day. Check out this post for more tips on how to get more quality sleep.

<h2>5. Give Yourself Time to Change Your Mindset</h2>
<h3>
Even though you want to see results immediately, it is going to take some time. Changing your thinking is difficult, and it may take a while for you to see results. It can be difficult to uproot your entire life with a bunch of new practices at the same time. Therefore, you should give yourself time to figure out what works best for you.


Also, you should be realistic, but persistent. In general, it takes approximately one month of consistently doing something to make it a habit. Remember to set smaller goes along the way. Try not to tackle too much at once. Small changes will eventually add up.

Changing your thinking is difficult, and it may take a while for you to see results.

Furthermore, you will need to set boundaries for your personal relationships and commitments. These boundaries can make it easier for you to keep commitments because you know what to expect from other people. You are never going to take on too much if you set these boundaries. As an example, if you do not want to work nights and weekends, set that expectation with your employer. You can even shut your phone off entirely to remind your co-workers you are not available on nights, weekends, or holidays. 

If you change your thinking, you will become more consistent. Keep this in mind when you are trying to change such a big part of your life.

<h2>6. Take Advantage of Motivational Tools</h2>
<h3>
Humans are not robots, there are going to be days where we do not feel like doing anything. That is why we all need to take advantage of motivational tools. What do you need to do if you need a bit of encouragement to do your work? Even though it can be easy to light our goals slide for a day, there are actions we can take to address this problem. If you feel down, lazy, tired, or in the dumps, there are a few ways you can gather some extra motivation. These include:


Remember to take breaks during the day. Reward yourself with a 5 or 10-minute break after every task you complete. This will give you more energy to finish your goals. 
Remember that you have long-term goals you are trying to hit. Think about how good you are going to feel when you achieve those long-term goals. Then, remember you were only going to hit them if you complete your to-do list every day.
It is okay to compromise from time to time. For example, you need to exercise regularly; however, you may not have the energy to do everything you planned for that day. Try to do something, but not every exercise you had planned.
Increase your knowledge about yourself and see what drives you by reading recommended books about motivation.
These are just a few of the ways you can stay motivated even when you feel down in the dumps. Think about putting a few of these tools to work for you. 
</h3>

<h2>7. Only Make Promises You Can Keep</h2>
<h3>
Another important have it you need to develop if you would like to be more consistent is to only make promises you can actually keep. People like to be liked by other people. Therefore, we all have a tendency to say yes when someone asks us for help. Even though it is good to help us other than we can, it is important not to make promises unless we can keep them. If you want to be more consistent in your life, you have to keep the promises you make. On the other hand, it is easy to get overwhelmed, causing certain commitments to fall through the cracks.

A few examples of this include:

Do not promise to give someone a ride unless you can actually keep that promise 
Do not tell your significant other you are going to handle your chores unless you can actually do so 
Do not promise to help someone move unless you can actually do that 

If you can keep some but not all elements of that commitment, consider a counter-proposal. For example, you may want to help someone move out; however, you do not get off work until 5 p.m. Offered to help them move in the evening instead of the middle of the day. 

Finally, this includes making promises to yourself. If you promise yourself to do something, make sure you can actually do that. Then, remember to place reminders around your home that remind you of the goal you are trying to hit.

8. Make an Effort to Reward Yourself</h2>
<h3>
If you are trying to become more consistent, make an effort to reward yourself when you do something well. After all, it is not easy to develop a new habit. Try to set time bass goals for yourself. Then, as you hit those goals, reward yourself for doing so. There are plenty of ways you can reward yourself for doing something well. These include: 

If you manage to finish your work early, consider going home early as well. That way, you may have time for some extra activities in the evening. You might treat yourself to a special dinner or try and see a movie.
If you have certain exercise goals you are trying to reach, you should reward yourself when you reach them. For example, you may want to celebrate with a night out on the town if you find you are getting in better shape or being more consistent in your workout routine. 
If you have done a good job maintaining relationships with your family members and friends, consider inviting everyone over for dinner to celebrate. 

Rewarding yourself or be more consistent is important because this reinforces a positive habit. Everyone has different ways of rewarding themselves. Do not hesitate to brainstorm ideas and reward yourself when you do something well.
