            Here, talk about how using complementary colors can really bring a website to life. Explaining how you can use dark backgrounds and colorful text will make your services stand out – you’re not just offering a standard black and white website made from a template, but something unique. Of course, you need to actually know what you’re talking about, and not just insist on using as many colors on a webpage as you can; that’s tacky.

          <h1>How To Maintain Consistency In Our Life
          </h1>
          <small>November, 2020</small>
          <p>
            Consistency means different things in different situations; however, the definition of consistency is putting forth a consistent effort day in and day out no matter what you do. There are numerous ways where consistency can be applied.

For example, students need to put forth a consistent effort in their classes. Employees and managers should put forth a consistent effort in their jobs every day. Everyone should be consistent in the effort they put forth in their relationships with their family members, friends, and colleagues.
